Difference between modern and contemporary interior design From madscreations.in
Modern furniture harkens to a particular design movement, the modernist movement that began in the early 1900s. Tom dixon’s lighting is classed as contemporary design, although it was inspired by the modern design movement, because it was created in the last decade. Modern and contemporary design are often confused and while they are similar, modern design refers to a specific era of design while contemporary design changes with the present. Metals, such as nickel, stainless steel, and chrome are also popular among furniture pieces boasting a contemporary style concept.
