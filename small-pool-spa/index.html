Spa in Swimming Pool HomesFeed From homesfeed.com
The smallest swim spas are usually 10 to 11 feet long, 7 to 8 feet wide, and 4 to 5 feet deep. Easier to maintain and with a smaller footprint, this swim spa is an ideal alternative to a traditional pool. A small freeform pool with water spouts and luscious plants turns a narrow plot into an airy, living space and could also be used to cool off on a hot day. Unlike a swimming pool, a spool comes equipped with jets that create a current against which you swim.
